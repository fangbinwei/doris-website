The resulting partitions in the above example are as follows:\n\n```\n*p201701_1000: [(MIN_VALUE, MIN_VALUE), ("2017-02-01", "1000") )\n*p201702_2000: [("2017-02-01", "1000"), ("2017-03-01", "2000") )\n*p201703_all: [("2017-03-01", "2000"), ("2017-04-01", MIN_VALUE))\n```\n\nNote that the last partition user defaults only the partition value of the `date` column, so the partition value of the `id` column will be filled with `MIN_VALUE` by default. When the user inserts data, the partition column values \u200b\u200bare compared in order, and the corresponding partition is finally obtained. Examples are as follows:\n\n```\n* Data --\x3e Partition\n* 2017-01-01, 200   --\x3e p201701_1000\n* 2017-01-01, 2000  --\x3e p201701_1000\n* 2017-02-01, 100   --\x3e p201701_1000\n* 2017-02-01, 2000  --\x3e p201702_2000\n* 2017-02-15, 5000  --\x3e p201702_2000\n* 2017-03-01, 2000  --\x3e p201703_all\n* 2017-03-10, 1     --\x3e p201703_all\n* 2017-04-01, 1000  --\x3e Unable to import\n* 2017-05-01, 1000  --\x3e Unable to import\n```\n')),(0,i.kt)("h5",{id:"list-partition-1"},"List Partition"),(0,i.kt)("pre",null,(0,i.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre"},'```\nPARTITION BY LIST(`id`, `city`)\n(\n    PARTITION `p1_city` VALUES IN (("1", "Beijing"), ("1", "Shanghai")),\n    PARTITION `p2_city` VALUES IN (("2", "Beijing"), ("2", "Shanghai")),\n    PARTITION `p3_city` VALUES IN (("3", "Beijing"), ("3", "Shanghai"))\n)\n```\n\nIn the above example, we specify `id`(INT type) and `city`(VARCHAR type) as partition columns.
